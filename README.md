# Triangle
Triangle Tracker
When you and your pair feel fairly comfortable integrating custom classes into Java applications, create another application that creates and evaluates triangles based on user-provided input.

Create a Triangle class.
Write a command line interface that allows users to input lengths for the 3 sides.
Create a Triangle object using these lengths.
Write a method in the Triangle class that returns whether the lengths form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle. If you're not familiar with these terms, here are definitions:
Equilateral: All sides are equal.
Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
Scalene: No sides are equal.
Also, keep in mind that not all combinations of three numbers make valid triangles! For example, (2, 2, 8) does not make a triangle. If any one side is longer than the other two combined, the lengths cannot form a triangle.
